# Hand Gesture Mouse

## Introduction

This project is a hand gesture mouse using OpenCV, Mediapipe and Python. It uses the cam to detect hand gestures and move the mouse accordingly.  
It also has fuctions to perform left and right clicks, and scroll up and down etc..

Right hand is used to control the mouse and left hand is used to perform other functions such as copy/paste, undo/redo etc.  
Left hand's functions can be customed by tkinter GUI.
